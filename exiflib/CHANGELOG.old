Date        Programmer      Version     Update
16.01.18    J. Berendt      2.0.0       Near complete code re-write.  Heavily modified and
                                        simplified original code.
                                        Previous update comments removed as they are no longer
                                        applicable.
                                        Results are now returned as a pandas Series, rather than
                                        as nested dictionaries.
                                        Updated code formatting per PEP8.
                                        Updated code formatting per PEP257.

22.01.18    J. Berendt      2.0.1       Updated to return a blank pandas Series if no exif data
                                        was retrieved.
                                        If no exif data is retrieved, the filename and full path
                                        values are returned in the Series.
06.02.19    J. Berendt      2.0.2       Converted from local package lib to installed package.
